## THE BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS

The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management template for creating new business models and documenting existing ones. It provides a visual chart with pieces detailing a firm's or product's value proposition, infrastructure, consumers, and finances, supporting firms in aligning their operations by demonstrating potential trade-offs.
